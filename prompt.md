a Streamlit app with an interactive forecasting dashboard that connects to a Salesforce Org for the data. Sidebar with filters. Styled like Google. Include a detailed README.md, and a requirements.txt file with the required packages. Must include visualizations: 1. A line chart showing the total number of opportunities by month. 2. A bar chart showing the total number of opportunities by stage. 3. A bar chart showing the total number of opportunities by lead source. 4. A bar chart showing the total number of opportunities by amount. 5. A line chart showing the total number of opportunities by close date. 6. A bar chart showing the total number of opportunities by type. 7. A bar chart showing the total number of opportunities by product.

Include the use of GPT-4 API in a meaninful and innovative way.

## Debugging

1. In `dashboard.py`, you are importing `selected_filters` from `sidebar.py`, but `selected_filters` is not defined in `sidebar.py`. Instead,  
you have a function called `create_sidebar()` that returns `filter_options` and `apply_filters`. You should call this function in 
`dashboard.py` to get the `selected_filters`.

Fix: In `dashboard.py`, replace the import statement with the following:

```python
from sidebar import create_sidebar
```

Then, call the `create_sidebar()` function in the `main()` function:

```python
selected_filters, apply_filters = create_sidebar()
```

2. In `data_processing.py`, the `load_data()` function expects a `file_path` argument, but you are not providing it when calling the function  
in other files. You should either provide a valid file path or set a default value for the `file_path` parameter.

Fix: Add a default value for the `file_path` parameter in `data_processing.py`:

```python
def load_data(file_path: str = "your_data_file.csv") -> pd.DataFrame:
```

Replace `your_data_file.csv` with the actual file name of your data file.

3. In `forecasting.py`, the `generate_forecast()` function expects two arguments: `data` and `selected_filters`. However, in `dashboard.py`,   
you are only providing one argument when calling this function. You should pass both `data` and `selected_filters` as arguments.

Fix: In `dashboard.py`, update the `generate_forecast()` function call:

```python
forecast_data = generate_forecast(preprocessed_data, selected_filters)
```

4. In `sidebar.py`, you are importing and using functions from `data_processing` and `forecasting` that are not needed in this file. You shouldremove these imports and the `update_sidebar_data()` function, as it is not being used.

Fix: Remove the following lines from `sidebar.py`:

```python
from data_processing import load_data, preprocess_data, apply_filters_to_data
from forecasting import generate_forecast
```

And remove the `update_sidebar_data()` function.

5. In `streamlit_app.py`, you are importing and using functions that are not needed or already implemented in `dashboard.py`. You should removethis file and use `dashboard.py` as your main Streamlit app file.

Fix: Delete the `streamlit_app.py` file and run your app using `dashboard.py`.

. Missing data file: Make sure the data file "your_data_file.csv" exists in the same directory as your Python files or provide the correct    
file path in the `load_data` function in `data_processing.py`.

2. Missing Streamlit package: Ensure that you have installed the Streamlit package using `pip install streamlit`.

3. Missing pandas package: Make sure you have installed the pandas package using `pip install pandas`.

4. Incorrect file execution: Ensure that you are running the `streamlit_app.py` file to start the Streamlit app. You can run the app using the 
command `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`.

5. Unused CSS file: The `styles.css` file is not being used in the current implementation. To apply the styles, you can use the `st.markdown`  
function to include the CSS in your Streamlit app. Add the following code to the `dashboard.py` file:

```python
def include_css(css_file: str):
    with open(css_file, "r") as f:
        css = f.read()
    st.markdown(f"<style>{css}</style>", unsafe_allow_html=True)

# Add this line at the beginning of the main() function in dashboard.py
include_css("styles.css")
```

6. Date range filter: The date range filter in `sidebar.py` returns a tuple with two dates, but it is not being used correctly in the 
`apply_filters_to_data` function in `data_processing.py`. You can update the function to handle the date range filter as follows:

```python
def apply_filters_to_data(data: pd.DataFrame, selected_filters: dict) -> pd.DataFrame:
    filtered_data = data.copy()
    
    for filter_key, filter_value in selected_filters.items():
        if filter_value:
            if filter_key == "date_range":
                start_date, end_date = filter_value
                filtered_data = filtered_data[(filtered_data["date"] >= start_date) & (filtered_data["date"] <= end_date)]
            else:
                filtered_data = filtered_data[filtered_data[filter_key] == filter_value]
    
    return filtered_data
```

Make sure your data has a "date" column with a proper date format for this to work.

7. Add altair<5 to requirements.txt

8. Set the sdk_version in README.md to 1.20.0

The error you are encountering is due to the use of `None` values in the `date_input` function in the `sidebar.py` file. The `date_input`      
function expects a valid date or a list of dates, but it is receiving `None` values, which is causing the TypeError.

To fix this issue, you can replace the `None` values with default date values. Here's how you can modify the `create_sidebar` function in the  
`sidebar.py` file:

```python
import datetime

def create_sidebar():
    st.sidebar.title("Filters")

    today = datetime.date.today()
    start_date = today - datetime.timedelta(days=30)
    end_date = today

    default_date_range = [start_date, end_date]
    date_range = st.sidebar.date_input("Date range", default_date_range)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
